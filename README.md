# Smartmath
**Smartmath** - this is an application that will help students and other math learners quickly get the solution to a problem and test themselves.

## Project description
**Smartmath** - is an educational application on Android for solving various mathematical problems. This application was developed to facilitate the process of solving certain mathematical problems that require many iterations.
At the moment, the following methods are implemented in the application:
* dichotomy;
* golden section.

After finding a solution that satisfies the given conditions, all data obtained during the solution can be viewed on an additional screen. This makes it possible to check your calculations from start to finish.

## Application features
* possibility to choose a mathematical method;
* availability of hints about possible mathematical operations (except for the basic ‘+, -, /, *’) when filling in the expression field;
* possibility to study the data for each iteration in detail;
* the ability to quickly return to the main menu from the screen with additional information.

## Used general libraries
* androidx.fragment
* net.objecthunter:exp4j
